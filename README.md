# SimpleMD

A simple markdown editor and previewer that is minimal yet fully featured. I wanted a lightweight editor where I could create markdown notes, have multiple style options, and export as a PDF.

Features:
- Split Editor/Preview
- Full Editor
- Full Preview
- Save to PDF
- Save to Markdown
- Mobile friendly
- Multiple style options (3 options currently but will most likely add more later - feel free to make a pull request)
- Autocompletion for most of the markdown syntax
- Local storage
